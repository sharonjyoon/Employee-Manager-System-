# Employee-Manager-System-
This application can help users keep track of their employees using the command line.
Users can input and store new employees and managers as well as their salaries.
Users can also input new departments and roles within the departments. Each department and role as well as each employee is given an id to help keep track of them. It is also possible for the user to update the roles of the employees. The application will also enable users to view updated tables of employees, roles, and departments. All of these items are stored in a mySQL database and will persist unless the database is dropped in the workbench. 


There is an explanation video in the Assets folder that will help guide users. 
There is also a screenshot of the database setup in the Assets folder as well.


Please be sure to install Node.js prior to using the application.


In addition please install in the command line:
npm install
npm install inquirer
npm install mysql2
npm install console.table --save
